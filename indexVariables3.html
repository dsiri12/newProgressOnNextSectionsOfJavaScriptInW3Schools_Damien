<h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>

<!-- the p element with the usual explanation about the x, y, z still being variables from the last couple examples before this specific example here -->
<p>In this example, x, y, and z are variables.</p>

<!-- the p element that contains an id called demo only -->
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

// the x variable declared by the let keyword that has a stored value of 5
let x = 5;

// the y variable being declared by the let keyword having a stored value of 6
let y = 6;

// the z variable is declared by the let keyword that has a value stored inside being the sum of the x and y variables that have the + operator in between of these 2 different variables
let z = x + y;

// the particular line of code (containing a break in between right after the assignment operator and the string wrapped in double quotes) that is telling the browser of this current document/webpage to print out what the string wrapped in double quotes and the z variable are being put together by the + operator in a new string into the HTML element in specific of the p element that only contains an id called demo
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The value of z is: " + z;
