<h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>

<!-- the p element that is explaining what x, y, z are of being variables -->
<p>In this example, x, y, and z are variables.</p>

<!-- the p element that contains only an id called demo and nothing else that is included -->
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

// the x variable being declared by the var keyword and has a stored value of 5
var x = 5;

// the y variable is declared by the var keyword and the value of 6 is stored inside of the y variable
var y = 6;

// the z variable declared by the var keyword and has the stored value of the sum of the x and y variables with the + operator in between of these 2 different variables
var z = x + y;

// line of code in particular (that has a break in between right after the = operator and before the string that is wrapped in double quotes) is telling the browser of this specific document/webpage to print out what the string being wrapped in double quotes and the z variable are being put together by the + operator into a new string right into the specific HTML element being the p element that only contains the id called demo
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The value of z is: " + z;
