// the text1 variable (declared by the let keyword) that is assigned a string value of "John"
let text1 = "John";

// the text2 variable (declared by the let keyword) being assigned a string value of "Doe"
let text2 = "Doe";

// the text3 variable (declared by the let keyword) that's assigned an expression that has the text1 variable, the string value of a space without any characters of any sort inside that's wrapped in double quotes, and the text2 variable that are each being concatenated by the + operator
let text3 = text1 + " " + text2;

// the particular line of code that is telling the browser of this document/webpage to output the text3 variable of it's own value into the HTML element being the p element containing an id called demo
