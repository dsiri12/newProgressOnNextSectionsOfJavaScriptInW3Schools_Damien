<!-- the p element that briefly explains how I can be able to use a variable before it's declared in terms of mainly the var keyword -->
<p>With <b>var</b>, you can use a variable before it is declared:</p>

<!-- the p element that contains only an id called demo and nothing else -->
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

// the carName variable that is assigned a string value wrapped in double quotes called "Volvo" without being declared by any keyword
carName = "Volvo";

// the particular line of code that is telling the browser of this document/webpage to print out the carName variable of it's string value into the HTML element being the p element containing an id called demo
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;

// the carName variable (declared by the var keyword) without being assigned to any string value while possibly still carrying the string value that's wrapped in double quotes called "Volvo"
var carName;
