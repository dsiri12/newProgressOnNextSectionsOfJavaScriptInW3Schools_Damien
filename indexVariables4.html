<h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>

<!-- the p element that explains what the variables are of each being x, y, z from what the other few examples have explained about before this particular example here -->
<p>In this example, x, y, and z are variables.</p>

<!-- the p element that contains an id called demo -->
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

// the x variable being declared by the const keyword that has a stored value of 5
const x = 5;

// the y variable is declared by the const keyword where the value of 6 is stored inside of the y variable
const y = 6;

// the z variable declared by the const keyword where the stored value is the sum of the x and y variables that have the + operator in between of these 2 different variables
const z = x + y;

// line of code (having a break in between right after the assignment operator and the string wrapped in double quotes) that is telling the browser of this specific document/webpage to print out what the string wrapped in double quotes and the z variable are being put together by the + operator as a result of a new string right into the specific HTML element being the p element that only contains an id called demo
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The value of z is: " + z;
