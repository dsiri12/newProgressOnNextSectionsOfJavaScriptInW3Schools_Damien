// the a variable (declared by the let keyword) that has a value of 3 stored in there
let a = 3;

// the x variable (declared by the let keyword) having a typical arithmetic operation that has 100 and 50 with the + operator in between of these numbers each being inside of the parentheses and then where the * operator and the a varible are right at the end of this typical arithmetic operation where the a variable of it's value is being multiplied by the sum of 100 and 50 from the parentheses on the left side of this typical arithmetic operation
let x = (100 + 50) * a;

// the particular line of code that is telling the browser of this document/browser to output the x variable of it's own value into the HTML element being the p element only containing an id called demo
