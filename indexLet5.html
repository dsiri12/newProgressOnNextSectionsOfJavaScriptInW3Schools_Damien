// the carName variable (without being declared by any keyword) that is assigned a string wrapped in double quotes called "Volvo"
carName = "Volvo";

// the line of code that is telling the browser to output the carName variable of it's assigned value called "Volvo" into the HTML element being the p element containing an id called demo
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;

// the carName variable being declared by the var keyword right after being assigned a string wrapped in double quotes called "Volvo" without being declared at first
var carName;
